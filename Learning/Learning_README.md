## 🔥 What are Learning Projects?

These are **self-contained Python projects** designed for **hands-on learning**.  
Each folder contains one focused experiment — ideal for:

- Understanding core Python concepts  
- Exploring **Computer Vision**, **ML**, and other Python libraries  
- Quick experimentation with minimal setup

## ⚡ How to run a project

```bash
cd Python-Projects/Learning/Project-1

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if available)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py
```

## ✨ Guidelines

- One project = one concept  
- Keep assets (models, XMLs, data) inside each project folder  
- Use simple names and clean code  
- Document anything tricky inside the project
